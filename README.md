# Tribal Test

Web page created as part of a test for Tribal Worldwide.

## Usage

Install the node modules
`npm install`

If you haven't got it installed already, install gulp
`npm install -global gulp`

To start development, you will need to simply run `gulp`.

## Notes

* I tried to take a Mobile First approach, even though there were no mobile designs :P
* I have used gulp as my build process/task runner.
* I have used flexbox quite extensively for laying out elements. In a real world project, dependent on the Browser Support Matrix provided I would include fallbacks for the use of flexbox i.e floats for older browsers. [Flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)
* Also, had I more time I would spend time refactoring the css and js.
